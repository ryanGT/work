# This is a file that specifies the Bodes to create from the data set.
# Each new Bode should begin with a label followed by a colon.  After
# the colon should be a comma separated list of key=value pairs.

# input and output are required keys and should correspond to data
# column labels.  

# Other valid keys include seedfreq, seedphase, freqlim, phaselim,
# maglim, and cohlim

# You may also specify top level data set options such as pat,
# truncstart, truncend, output, and plot.  Each of these should be
# on a line by themselves with key = value (spaces opitonal).

# pat is the glob pattern to specify which txt data files you want
# included in the data set.

# truncstart and truncend are in Hz and specify how much of the Bode
# plot you want to keep.

# output is the basename for saving the time domain and Bode data.  Be
# sure that output is a valid name for a python module since it will
# eventually be imported in a manner similar to "import output"

# plot tells the main script whether or not to call show() at the end
# and to actually plot the Bodes
